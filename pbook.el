;;;# Introduction
;;;
;;; Have you ever printed out a program and read it on paper?
;;;
;;; It is an interesting exercise to try with one of your own
;;; programs, one that you think is well-written. The first few times
;;; you will probably find that it's torture to try and read in a
;;; straight line. What seemed so nice in Emacs is riddled with
;;; glaring problems on paper.
;;;
;;; How a program reads on paper may not be very important in itself,
;;; but there is wonderful upside to this. If you go through the
;;; program with a red pen and fix all the mind-bendingly obvious
;;; problems you see, what happens is that the program greatly
;;; improves -- not just on paper, but also in Emacs!
;;;
;;; This is a marvellously effective way to make programs
;;; better.
;;;
;;; Let's explore the idea some more!
;;;
;;;# `pbook'
;;;
;;; This program, `pbook', is a tool for making readable programs by
;;; generating LaTeX'ified program listings. Its purpose is to help
;;; you improve your programs by making them read well on paper. It
;;; serves this end by generating pretty-looking PDF output for you to
;;; print out and attack with a red pen, and perhaps use the medium to
;;; trick your mind into seeking the clarity of a technical paper and
;;; bringing your prose-editing skills to bear on your source code.
;;;
;;; `pbook' is aware of three things: headings, top-level comments,
;;; and code. Headings become LaTeX sections, and have entries in a
;;; table of contents. Top-level comments become plain text in a nice
;;; variable-width font. Other source code is listed as-is in a
;;; fixed-width font.
;;;
;;; These different elements are distinguished in the source using
;;; maximally unobtrusive markup, which you can see at work in the
;;; `pbook.el' source code.
;;;
;;; Read on to see the program and how it works.
;;;
;;;# Prelude
;;;
;;; I have successfully tested this program with GNU Emacs versions
;;; 20.7 and 21.3, and with XEmacs version 21.5.
;;;
;;; For some tiny luxuries and portability help we use the Common Lisp
;;; compatibility library:
(require 'cl)

;;;# Emacs commands
;;;
;;; A handful of Emacs commands make up the pbook user-interface. The
;;; most fundamental is to render a pbook-formatted Emacs buffer as
;;; LaTeX.

(defun pbook-buffer ()
  "Generate LaTeX from the current (pbook-formatted) buffer.
The resulting source is displayed in a buffer called *pbook*."
  (interactive)
  (pbook-process-buffer))

;;; A very handy utility is to display a summary of the buffer's
;;; structure and use it to jump to an appropriate section. I've
;;; always enjoyed being able to do this in texinfo-mode. Happily,
;;; pbook gets this for free using the `occur' function, which lists
;;; all lines in the buffer that match some regular expression.

(defun pbook-show-structure ()
  "Display the pbook heading structure of the current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (occur pbook-heading-regexp))

;;; To avoid a lot of mucking about in the shell there is also a
;;; command to generate and display a PDF file. This function is a
;;; quick hack to make experimentation easy.

(defun pbook-buffer-view-pdf ()
  "Generate and display PDF from the current buffer.
The intermediate files are created in the standard temporary
directory."
  (interactive)
  (save-window-excursion
    (pbook-buffer))
  (with-current-buffer "*pbook*"
    (let ((texfile (pbook-tmpfile "pbook" "tex"))
          (pdffile (pbook-tmpfile "pbook" "pdf")))
      (write-region (point-min) (point-max) texfile)
      ;; Possibly there is a better way to ensure that LaTeX generates
      ;; the table of contents correctly than to run it more than
      ;; once, but I don't know one.
      (shell-command (format "\
  cd /tmp; latex %s && pdflatex %s && acroread %s &"
                             texfile texfile pdffile)))))

(defun pbook-tmpfile (name extension)
  "Return the full path to a temporary file called NAME and with EXTENSION.
An appropriate directory is chosen and the PID of Emacs is
inserted before the extension."
  (format "%s%s-%S.%s"
          (if (boundp 'temporary-file-directory)
              temporary-file-directory
            ;; XEmacs does it this way instead:
            (temp-directory))
          name (emacs-pid) extension))

;;;# Configurable variables
;;;
;;; These are variables that can be customized to affect pbook's
;;; behaviour. The default regular expressions assume Lisp-style
;;; comment characters, but they can be overridden with buffer-local
;;; bindings from hooks for other programming modes. The other
;;; variables that control formatting are best configured with Emacs's
;;; magic "file variables" (see down the very bottom for an example).

(defvar pbook-commentary-regexp "^;;;\\($\\|[^#]\\)"
  "Regular expression matching lines of high-level commentary.")

(defvar pbook-heading-regexp "^;;;\\(#+\\)"
  "Regular expression matching heading lines of chapters/sections/headings.")

(defvar pbook-heading-level-subexp 1
  "The subexpression of `pbook-heading-regexp' whose length indicates nesting.")

(defvar pbook-include-toc t
  "When true include a table of contents.")

(defvar pbook-style 'article
  "Style of output. Either article (small) or book (large).")

(defvar pbook-author (user-full-name)
  "The name to use in the \author LaTeX command.")

;;;# Top-level logic
;;;
;;; Here we have the top level of the program. Setting up, calling the
;;; formatting engine, piecing things together, and putting on the
;;; finishing touches.
;;;
;;; The real work is done in a new buffer called *pbook*. First the
;;; source is copied into this buffer and from there it is massaged
;;; into shape.
;;;
;;; Most of this is mundane, but there is one tricky part: the source
;;; buffer may have buffer-local values for some pbook settings, and
;;; we have to be careful or we'd lose them when switching into the
;;; *pbook* buffer. This is taken care of by moving the correct values
;;; of all the relevant customizable settings into new dynamic
;;; bindings.
